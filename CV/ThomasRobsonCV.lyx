Cyber Security Summer School July 2016 – September 2016 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I took part in a 10-week summer school over the summer of 2016 to enhance
 my technical skills.
 Among the topics covered were networking, secure coding in C/C++ and python,
 low level operating systems and many aspects of computer security.
 This school consisted of a combination of learning about cyber security
 issues and trying both offence and defence using some of these techniques
 in a controlled laboratory environment using the tools supplied within
 the Kali Linux distribution by Offensive Security.

In the summer of 2012, I had the opportunity to take part in the UK Japan
 Young Scientist Workshop at Cambridge University.
 This was a week long collaboration between schools in the UK and Japan
 to take part in research projects with academics.
 My group examined ‘Nuclear Energy and the public perception of radiation’
 with Professor Wade Allison, a world-leading researcher on the subject.
 I gave a presentation at the end of the week on our project to the events
 sponsors and special guests, which was an invaluable opportunity to develop
 my public speaking and presentation skills.

\begin_layout Standard
I participated in two Young Rewired State events in the summers of 2012
 and 2013, working in the Reading centre in the offices of Microsoft.
 These events are designed to introduce young people to the process of software
 development and after a week of development the event ended with a contest
 in Birmingham where all the centres came together.
 This was my first experience of programming and the software development
 process, and I greatly enjoyed the two projects that saw us create web
 applications based on open source data.
